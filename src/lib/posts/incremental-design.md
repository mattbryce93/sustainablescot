excerpt: Covering the basics of Incremental Design and its benefits.
---

Incremental Urban Design is a planning and design approach that focuses on making gradual, incremental changes to the built environment over time. 
The goal of Incremental Urban Design is to improve the livability and sustainability of urban areas in a flexible and responsive manner, rather than making large-scale, top-down changes. 

## Benefits of Incremental Urban Design:

### Encourages Community Involvement:

Incremental Urban Design encourages community involvement in the planning and design process, allowing residents to have a say in the changes that are being made to their community. 
This can increase community buy-in and support for urban design projects.

### Promotes Flexibility: 

Incremental Urban Design is a flexible approach, allowing for changes to be made over time in response to changing needs and conditions. 
This can help to ensure that urban design projects are more adaptable to the changing needs of a community over time.

### Improves Livability: 

Incremental Urban Design focuses on making gradual changes to the built environment that improve livability. 
This can include improving public spaces, widening pavements and installing bike lanes, and increasing access to public transportation. 

### Minimises Disruptions: 

Incremental Urban Design minimises disruptions to the built environment and to the lives of residents. 
It achieves this by avoiding large-scale construction projects and reducing the need for residents to relocate or adjust to major changes all at once.
This can help to reduce the negative impacts of urban design projects and increase support for future projects. 

### Encourages Experimentation: 

Incremental Urban Design encourages experimentation, allowing for new and innovative design solutions to be tested and refined over time. This can help to improve the quality and effectiveness of urban design projects.

## How could we use Incremental Urban Design?

Incremental Urban Design is a flexible and responsive approach to planning and design that can help to improve the livability and sustainability of urban areas. By making gradual changes to the built environment, Incremental Urban Design can help to create more livable, sustainable, and responsive communities.
